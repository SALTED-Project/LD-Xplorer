## Introduction


#### üìù Description

The efficacy of data hinges on its strategic linkage with other data, transcending mere data points to yield practical information in the real world. The NGSI-type data, rife with explicit (e.g., references to other entities) and implicit (e.g., temporal or spatial proximity) links, facilitates systematic exploration.
Our objective is to operationalize this concept through the development of a web application. This application, consisting of both frontend and a basic backend, will leverage Scorpio for efficient data querying and display. Users, including European taxpayers, potential project partners, and data suppliers, will navigate the linked data graph by initiating queries from a single entity.
This interactive process involves tracing explicit and implicit links, offering users a deep dive into data relationships. The overarching goal is to present a tangible, experiential understanding of data interconnectivity. This technical framework not only serves end-users but also acts as a catalyst for data suppliers, encouraging them to share their data within this collaborative environment.

#### üèÜ Value Proposition

The added value of our NGSI-LD-based web application lies in its capacity to demystify data interconnectivity. By showcasing explicit and implicit links between entities, the application not only facilitates efficient data exploration but also promotes collaboration. Data suppliers are motivated to contribute to a shared knowledge pool, realizing the practical benefits of their participation. Beyond immediate gains, users are equipped with a solid foundation in understanding linked data concepts, positioning them to adapt to future advancements. In essence, our application adds value by making abstract concepts tangible, fostering collaboration, and future-proofing knowledge in the evolving landscape of data connectivity.
